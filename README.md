# css-bouncer


A CSS Linter with rules as plugins. CSS Bouncer is a harness to run CSS rules.

## Some Plugins

CSS Bouncer by itself is rather useless. You'll need to either install or write some plugins for it to be useful.

Please prefix public CSS Bouncer rules in npm with `cssb-` to aid with finding rules.
